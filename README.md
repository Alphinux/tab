# tab: a startpage
_a startpage, new tab page, homepage_

Tab lives [here](https://koryschneider.github.io/tab-a-startpage). Please read below if you haven't used it before.

## Usage

#### General
The purpose of this site is to use short, simple commands to access and search websites quickly.

The syntax is as follows: `command[;query][;n]`

Commands are shortcuts for sites (e.g. `y` for YouTube). If you simply enter a command, it will take you to that site.

<sup>For a full list of commands and what they do, take a look at the [help menu](#menus).</sup>

You can search sites by separating the command and your query with a semicolon. If you wanted to search YouTube for cat videos, you would enter: `y;cat videos`. (Note that leading/trailing spaces get stripped, so entering `y; cat videos` will do the same thing.)

If you do not enter a command, the input will be taken as a query and the default command will be executed. The default default command is Google, but this can be changed in the [options menu](#menus).

Some commands behave slightly differently. For example, the Reddit command (`r`) will take you to a subreddit rather than searching Reddit. Example: `r;askreddit`. With this particular command you can also do things like: `r;askreddit/top?t=month` to quickly get where you want to be.

If you want to go to a website that does not have an associated command, you can use the `t` command like so: `t;gmail.com` (opens gmail.com in the current tab).

If you want to open your command in a new tab, you can add `;n` to the end of your command, like this: `img;coffee;n`. In the options menu you can make this the default behavior.

#### Menus
There are two menus you can access: help and options.

 - To get to the __help__ menu, enter `help` or `?`. <sup>(you can also click on the clock)</sup>

 - To get to the __options__ menu, enter `options` or `settings`.
