## Usage

#### Intro
The purpose of this site is to use short, simple commands to access and search websites quickly.

The syntax is as follows: `command;query[;n]`

Commands are shortcuts for sites (e.g. `y` for YouTube). You can search sites by separating the command and your query with a semicolon. If you wanted to search YouTube for cat videos, you would enter: `y;cat videos`. If you simply enter a command and no query, it will take you to that site. (Note that leading/trailing spaces get stripped, so entering `y; cat videos` will do the same thing.)

<sup>For a full list of commands and what they do, refer to the command list in the help menu (see [menus](#menus) section below).</sup>

#### Examples
Here some sample inputs and what they do:

 - `y;cat videos` searches YouTube for 'cat videos'.

 - `r;askreddit` takes you to the AskReddit subreddit.

 - `n;fargo` searches Netflix for 'fargo'.

 - `imdb;pulp fiction` searches Internet Movie DataBase for 'pulp fiction'.

 - `t;gmail.com` opens gmail.com in the current tab.

 - `a;popsicles;n` searches Amazon for popsicles in a new tab.

 
Some commands behave slightly differently. For example, the `r` command will take you to a subreddit rather than searching Reddit (e.g. `r;askreddit`). With this particular command you can also do things like `r;askreddit/top?t=month` to quickly get where you want to be. The `t` command takes a URL instead of a query, e.g. `t;gmail.com`.

If you do not enter a command, the input will be taken as a query and the default command will be executed. The default default command is Google, but this can be changed in the options menu. <sup>(again, see [menus](#menus) section below).</sup>



#### Menus
There are two menus you can access: help and options.

 - To get to the _help_ menu, enter `help` or `?`. <sup>(you can also click on the clock)</sup>

 - To get to the _options_ menu, enter `options` or `settings`.
